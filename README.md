# HashNexus

## Project Description
**HashNexus** is a blockchain-based document verification system that allows users to securely store and validate the authenticity of digital documents using their cryptographic hashes. It eliminates the need for third-party verification by providing a decentralized proof of existence for any file.

## Project Vision
The vision of **HashNexus** is to build a **trustless, transparent, and permanent** record-keeping system where individuals and organizations can verify document authenticity directly on the blockchain — ensuring **integrity**, **ownership**, and **immutability**.

## Key Features
- 🧩 **Document Hash Registration**: Users can register a unique hash of any document.
- 🔍 **Instant Verification**: Anyone can verify if a document exists and view its registration details.
- 🔐 **Ownership Tracking**: Each document is linked to the wallet address that registered it.
- ⏱️ **Timestamp Proof**: The blockchain timestamp acts as verifiable proof of document creation time.

## Future Scope
- 🌐 Integration with IPFS for decentralized file storage.
- 📄 Support for digital signatures and certificates.
- 🧠 Incorporation of AI-based document similarity detection to prevent duplicate records.
- 🪙 Token-based incentive system for document authenticity validation.
- 🔗 Cross-chain verification across multiple blockchain networks.
